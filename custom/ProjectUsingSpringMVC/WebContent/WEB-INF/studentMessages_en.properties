Size.employee1.empHobby={0} must be between {2} and {1} characters. It comes from properties file
#Placeholder {0} is always replaced dynamically by spring mvc with the name of the field
#Placeholder {1},{2},{3},{4} and so on..would be replaced with the argument values passed to the constraint annotation
#Sping mvc uses alphabetical order of the arguments to decide upon which placeholder to be replaced with which argument 
#value. That's why max is replaced by {1} and min is replaced by {2}
